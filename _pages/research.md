<summary> <font size="5"> Fisher matrix forecasts on the astrophysics of galaxies during the epoch of reionisation from the 21-cm power spectra </font> </summary>

The hyperfine 21-cm transition of neutral hydrogen from the early Universe ($z>5$) is a sensitive probe of the formation and evolution of the first luminous sources. Using the Fisher matrix formalism we explore the complex and degenerate high-dimensional parameter space associated with the high-$z$ sources of this era and forecast quantitative constraints from a future 21-cm power spectrum  (21-cm PS) detection. This is achieved using MERAXES, a coupled semi-analytic galaxy formation model and reionisation simulation, applied to an $N$-body halo merger tree with a statistically complete population of all atomically cooled galaxies out to $z\sim20$. Our mock observation assumes a 21-cm detection spanning $z \in [5, 24]$ from a 1000 h mock observation with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array and is calibrated with respect to ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) at $z\in[5, 10]$, the optical depth of CMB photons to Thompson scattering from Planck, and various constraints on the IGM neutral fraction at $z > 5$. In this work, we focus on the X-ray luminosity, ionising UV photon escape fraction, star formation and supernova feedback of the first galaxies. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover 5 of the 8 parameters describing these properties with better than $50$ per cent precision using just the 21-cm PS. By combining with UV LFs, we are able to improve our forecast, with 5 of the 8 parameters constrained to better than $10$ per cent (and all below 50 per cent).

## Thermal and reionization history within a large-volume semi-analytic galaxy formation simulation [ðŸ”—](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221008910B/abstract)

We predict the 21-cm global signal and power spectra during the Epoch of Reionisation using the MERAXES semi-analytic galaxy formation and reionisation model, updated to include X-ray heating and thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium. Studying the formation and evolution of galaxies together with the reionisation of cosmic hydrogen using semi-analytic models (such as MERAXES) requires *N*-body simulations within large volumes and high mass resolutions. For this, we use a simulation of side-length $210~h^{-1}$ Mpc with $4320^3$ particles resolving dark matter haloes to masses of $5\times10^8~h^{-1}~M_\odot$. To reach the mass resolution of atomically cooled galaxies, thought to be the dominant population contributing to reionisation, at $z=20$ of $\sim 2\times10^7~h^{-1}~M_\odot$, we augment this simulation using the DARKFOREST Monte-Carlo merger tree algorithm (achieving an effective particle count of $\sim10^{12}$). Using this augmented simulation we explore the impact of mass resolution on the predicted reionisation history as well as the impact of X-ray heating on the 21-cm global signal and the 21-cm power spectra. We also explore the cosmic variance of 21-cm statistics within $70^{3}$ $h^{-3}$ Mpc$^3$ sub-volumes. We find that the midpoint of reionisation varies by $\Delta z\sim0.8$ and that the cosmic variance on the power spectrum is underestimated by a factor of 2-4 at $k\sim$ 0.1-0.4 Mpc$^{-1}$ due to the non-Gaussian nature of the 21-cm signal. To our knowledge, this work represents the first model of both reionisation and galaxy formation which resolves low-mass atomically cooled galaxies while simultaneously sampling sufficiently large scales necessary for exploring the effects of X-rays in the early Universe.
