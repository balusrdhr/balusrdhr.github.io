  The hyperfine 21-cm transition of neutral hydrogen from the early Universe ($z>5$) is a sensitive probe of the formation and evolution of the first luminous sources. Using the Fisher matrix formalism we explore the complex and degenerate high-dimensional parameter space associated with the high-$z$ sources of this era and forecast quantitative constraints from a future 21-cm power spectrum  (21-cm PS) detection. This is achieved using MERAXES, a coupled semi-analytic galaxy formation model and reionisation simulation, applied to an $N$-body halo merger tree with a statistically complete population of all atomically cooled galaxies out to $z\sim20$. Our mock observation assumes a 21-cm detection spanning $z \in [5, 24]$ from a 1000 h mock observation with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array and is calibrated with respect to ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) at $z\in[5, 10]$, the optical depth of CMB photons to Thompson scattering from Planck, and various constraints on the IGM neutral fraction at $z > 5$. In this work, we focus on the X-ray luminosity, ionising UV photon escape fraction, star formation and supernova feedback of the first galaxies. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover 5 of the 8 parameters describing these properties with better than $50$ per cent precision using just the 21-cm PS. By combining with UV LFs, we are able to improve our forecast, with 5 of the 8 parameters constrained to better than $10$ per cent (and all below 50 per cent).

Using a semi-analytic galaxy-formation model, we study analogues of 8 recently discovered JWST galaxies at $z{\gtrsim}12$. We select analogues from a cosmological simulation with a $(311{\rm cMpc})^3$ volume and an effective particle number of $10^{12}$ enabling resolution of every atomic-cooling galaxy at $z{\le}20$. We vary model parameters to reproduce the observed UV luminosity function at $5{<}z{<}13$, aiming for a statistically representative high-redshift galaxy mock catalogue. Using the forward-modelled JWST photometry, we identify analogues from this catalogue and study their properties as well as possible evolutionary paths and local environment. We find faint JWST galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}{\gtrsim}-19.5$) to remain consistent with standard galaxy-formation model and that our fiducial catalogue includes large samples of their analogues. The properties of these analogues broadly agree with conventional SED fitting results, except for having systematically lower redshifts due to the evolving UV luminosity function, and for having higher specific star formation rates as a result of burstier histories in our model. On the other hand, only a handful of bright galaxy analogues can be identified for the observed $z{\sim}12$ galaxies. Moreover, in order to reproduce the $z{\gtrsim}16$ JWST galaxy candidates, boosting star-forming efficiencies through reduced feedback regulation and increased gas depletion rate is necessary relative to models of lower-redshift populations. This suggests star formation in the first galaxies could differ significantly from their lower-redshift counterparts. We also find that these candidates are subject to low-redshift contamination, which is present in our fiducial results as both the dusty or quiescent galaxies at $z{\sim}5$.

We predict the 21-cm global signal and power spectra during the Epoch of Reionisation using the MERAXES semi-analytic galaxy formation and reionisation model, updated to include X-ray heating and thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium. Studying the formation and evolution of galaxies together with the reionisation of cosmic hydrogen using semi-analytic models (such as MERAXES) requires *N*-body simulations within large volumes and high mass resolutions. For this, we use a simulation of side-length $210~h^{-1}$ Mpc with $4320^3$ particles resolving dark matter haloes to masses of $5\times10^8~h^{-1}~M_\odot$. To reach the mass resolution of atomically cooled galaxies, thought to be the dominant population contributing to reionisation, at $z=20$ of $\sim 2\times10^7~h^{-1}~M_\odot$, we augment this simulation using the DARKFOREST Monte-Carlo merger tree algorithm (achieving an effective particle count of $\sim10^{12}$). Using this augmented simulation we explore the impact of mass resolution on the predicted reionisation history as well as the impact of X-ray heating on the 21-cm global signal and the 21-cm power spectra. We also explore the cosmic variance of 21-cm statistics within $70^{3}$ $h^{-3}$ Mpc$^3$ sub-volumes. We find that the midpoint of reionisation varies by $\Delta z\sim0.8$ and that the cosmic variance on the power spectrum is underestimated by a factor of 2-4 at $k\sim$ 0.1-0.4 Mpc$^{-1}$ due to the non-Gaussian nature of the 21-cm signal. To our knowledge, this work represents the first model of both reionisation and galaxy formation which resolves low-mass atomically cooled galaxies while simultaneously sampling sufficiently large scales necessary for exploring the effects of X-rays in the early Universe.
