I'm a second-year PhD student at the University of Melbourne supervised by [Prof. Stuart Wyithe](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/stuart-wyithe/){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr Bradley Greig](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/195326-bradley-greig). My research focuses mostly on an early phase in the history of our Universe known as the [Epoch of Reionisation](https://astro.physics.unimelb.edu.au/research/epoch-of-reionisation/) (EoR) which happened in the first billion years after the Big Bang.

The EoR constitutes the last major phase-change in the history of our Universe when almost all of the neutral hydrogen atoms were reionised by the photons from the first generation of stars and galaxies. This had an impact on all subsequent galaxy formation and evolution. One of the cool things about astronomy is that when you look deeper into the sky, you are also looking back in time. Several low-frequency radio telescopes are either in operation/planned to observe the 21-cm emission of hydrogen from the EoR. I am interested in simulating what these telescopes will observe and how we can efficiently model the young Universe to extract the maximum amount of information about this exciting period.

I am from a small town in the south Indian state of [Kerala](https://www.keralatourism.org/kerala-at-a-glance/) (where we speak [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam)). After studying chemistry for two years, I dropped out to pursue my passion for physics at Pondicherry University in the union territory of [Puducherry](https://www.py.gov.in/history) (where [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) is the main language). The beaches and French-era buildings of Puducherry will always have a special place in my heart! 

I found my passion in astrophysics quite fortuitously when I opted to specialise in it for my masters. I also had a great time working with [Assoc. Prof. Maheswar Gopinathan](https://www.iiap.res.in/?q=user/541) at the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics](https://www.iiap.res.in/), Bangalore during my masters. After completing my masters, I spent some time as a visiting student in the [DISTORTION](https://wwws.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/) group at the [Raman Research Institute](https://www.rri.res.in/).

Note about my name: We employ a [patronymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic#South_Asia) naming system where I am from which means that Sreedhar is my father's given name and not my family name. (**TLDR**: Mr Sreedhar is my father and I am Mr Balu!)
