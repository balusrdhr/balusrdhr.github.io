I'm a second-year PhD student at the University of Melbourne. I am advised  supervised by [Prof. Stuart Wyithe](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/stuart-wyithe/) and [Dr. Bradley Greig](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/195326-bradley-greig). My research focuses mostly on an early phase in the history of our Universe known as the [Epoch of Reionisation](https://astro.physics.unimelb.edu.au/research/epoch-of-reionisation/).

In short, EoR constitutes the last major phase-change in the history of the Universe when almost all of the neutral hydrogen atom in the Universe was reionised by the ionising photons from the first generation of stars and galaxies. One of the cool things about astronomy is that when you look farther and farther away into the sky, you are also looking back in time. A number of low-frequency radio telescopes are in operation (and more planned) to observe the the 21-cm emission of the hydrogen from the EoR. I am interested in trying to simulate what these telesopes will observe and how we can efficiently model the young Universe so that we can extract the maximum amount of information about this exciting period.

I am from a small town in the southern state of [Kerala, India](https://www.keralatourism.org/kerala-at-a-glance/)(where we speak [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam)). After studying chemistry for two years, I dropped out to pursue my passion for physics at Pondicherry University in the union territory of [Puducherry](https://www.py.gov.in/history)(where Tamil is the main language). The beaches and French-era buildings of Puducherry will always have a special place in my heart! 

I found my passion in astrophysics quite fortuitously when I opted for specialising in it for my masters. I also had a great time working with [Assoc. Prof. Maheswar Gopinathan](https://www.iiap.res.in/?q=user/541) at the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics](https://www.iiap.res.in/), Bangalore during my masters. After that I spent some time as a visiting student in the [DISTORTION](https://www.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/index.html) group at the [Raman Research Institute](https://www.rri.res.in/).

Note about my name: We employ [patronymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic#South_Asia) naming system which means that Sreedhar is the given name of my father and not my family name. (**tldr**: Mr. Sreedhar is my father and I am Mr. Balu!)
